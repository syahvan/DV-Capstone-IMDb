# Data Visualization Capstone - IMDb

Welcome to my Data Visualization Capstone Project for Algoritma Data Science School! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

This project leverages IMDb movie data spanning from 1903 to 2023, sourced from Kaggle. The dataset is available for download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashpalsingh1525/imdb-movies-dataset/). I've visualized and analyzed this data to extract meaningful insights, and you can explore the results interactively through my [Shiny Apps](https://syahvan.shinyapps.io/imdb/).

## Project Structure
- **global.R**: Contains code for loading and preprocessing data, as well as global variables.
- **server.R**: Houses the server-side logic for the Shiny App, including data manipulation and visualization rendering.
- **ui.R**: Defines the user interface components and layout for the Shiny App.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Shiny App by executing the `runApp()` function in your R environment.
3. Explore the visualizations and gain insights into the IMDb movie dataset.

## Feedback

I value your feedback! If you have any suggestions, ideas, or find any issues with the project, please don't hesitate to open an issue or reach out to me directly. Your insights are highly appreciated!

Thank you for dropping by! ðŸš€
