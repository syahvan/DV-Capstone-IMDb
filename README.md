# Data Visualization Capstone - IMDb
Hello :)

This is my work for **Algoritma's Data Visualization Capstone Project**. The data source is from Kaggle which contained IMDb movie data from 1903-2023, you can download it from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashpalsingh1525/imdb-movies-dataset/). You can also see the result in my [Shiny Apps](https://syahvan.shinyapps.io/imdb/) and any feedback regarding everything is very welcomed. Thanks for dropping by and enjoy!
